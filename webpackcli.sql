(2, 16, 'Trip', 'Africa', 'accessibility make it a favorite with locals and visitors alike. It’s one of the most popular parks in Africa, and the Kruger camps are definitely the flashiest I’ve ever stayed in. You can take your own car, and many of the roads are paved, but you can also go on game drives on unsealed tracks. The camps are surrounded by electric fences, so you won’t have to fear coming across a large cat if you need a toilet break at night. If the planned extensions into Zimbabwe and Mozambique take place, Kruger will become the largest nature reserve on the planet. Because of its high standards, though, Kruger can sometimes feel like a massive zoo. Try to avoid the school holiday periods when the camps are usually full. I loved my time there.\n\nKruger National Park is pretty easy to visit if you have a car (you can just drive there and stay at a lodge), but while I noticed a lot of people self-driving through the park, having a guide to spot animals and explain the ecosystem of the park made the experience much richer (these guys have eagle eyes!). If you’re going to Kruger, the end of the dry season (August–November) is the best time to visit, because the lack of watering holes means animals have fewer places to congregate around, making them easier to see.\n\nEtosha National Park — Namibia\nA stunning photo from a safari in Etosha National Park, Namibia\n(etoshanationalpark.org)\nEtosha (meaning the “great white place of dry water”) in northern Namibia was my first-ever safari. The best part is the Okaukeujo camping ground, located near a watering hole that is floodlit at night. Since most of the animals are active at night, you get a good look at their natural behavior. I remember watching a sole rhino having a drink, when an enormous bull elephant entered the frame. The lone rhino swiveled 180 degrees, snorted, scraped all four feet on the dusty ground and charged. The elephant panicked and accelerated into the crunchy Namibian bush. The rhino returned to his spot, finished his drink, and finally waddled off into the darkness. Opening hours change weekly and are based on sunrise and sunset. A one day pass for adults is NAD 80 NAD. Children under 16 years are free of charge.\n\nSouth Luangwa National Park — Zambia\nA stunning sunset over South Luwangwa National Park, Zambia\n(+265 (0) 111 746 449, southluangwasafaris.com)\nWhile it’s not well known, this isolated part of Zambia is definitely worth the trip. This place makes you feel like you are truly in the wild. The camps are unfenced and situated next to the South Luangwa River, where you can watch hippos and crocodiles swim past your tent. This is my favorite game park, because it lacks the hordes of vehicles you see in so many other parks. South Luangwa has one of the highest concentrations of leopards — the most elusive member of the Big 5 — and this is the only place in Africa I’ve seen one.\n\nSerengeti National Park and Masai Mara National Park — Tanzania and Kenya\nSerengeti National Park and Masai Mara National Park in Tanzania and Kenya\n(serengeti.org, masaimaranationalpark.org)\nThe Serengeti and Masai Mara National Parks are probably the most famous parks in this list, and for good reason. Since most of the landscape is savannah (or flat grasslands), wildlife visibility is very high. The parks adjoin each other across two countries and are best known for the annual wildebeest migration that involves the treacherous crossing of the Mara River, usually around July or August. It’s also easy to spot many of the great cats here. The Serengeti park is open from March to November from 10am to 5pm. Park fees for Masai Mara are 70 USD for non-residents and are valid for 24 hours.\n\nNgorogoro Crater — Tanzania\nThree wildebeest on the Ngorogoro Crater in Tanzania\n(+255 773 255 974, ngorongorocrater.org)\nThis crater formed millions of years ago when a giant volcano exploded.

(3, 16, 'Thailand Vacation', 'BANGKOK', 'BANGKOK\n\nWhen people tell me they hate Bangkok, I understand. When I first went to Bangkok in 2006, I despised the city and couldn’t wait to get out.\n\nIt wasn’t until I lived in the city that I really fell in love with it.\n\nBangkok is not a city that opens itself up easily, and most people spend just a day or two here before leaving to go to the islands or the jungle. But while as a tourist you may not need tons of time to “see” the city, Bangkok is worth more than quick stay most travlers give it.\n\nBangkok may not have a lot of “tourist attractions” in the way that Paris, London, NYC, and Buenos Aires do but that’s OK. Bangkok is not that kind of city. Bangkok is a place to wander, eat, and imbibe. It doesn’t have to be a love-it-or-hate-it city but it is worth seeing. Check out my list of things to do in Bangkok\n\nHere’s my suggested itinerary for what to see and do Bangkok that will have you ticking off the major sites as well some of the lesser places to go:\n\nThe Grand Palace, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun\n\nThe first place you should visit in Bangkok is the Grand Palace (Royal Palace) and neighboring Wat Pho, home to the famous reclining Buddha and massage school. The Royal family doesn’t live in the palace (it’s only used for official state functions) and you can’t go into any of the buildings, but wandering the grounds and open temples is worth the visit. It’s beautiful and the craftsmanship in the architecture is amazing. Go first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds.\n\nAfterwards, wander down the street to Wat Pho and the famous reclining Buddha (as well as the famous Golden Buddha). The Wat Pho complex fills a city block so while seeing the statues doesn’t take long, you could spend a solid hour wandering the maze-like temple grounds.\n\nNext, head across the river to Wat Arun (Temple of the Dawn) and get stellar views of the city from atop the temple. It’s my favorite temple in the city because of the view!\n\nThe Grand Palace is located on Na Phra Lan Road, +66 2 623 5500. Open daily from 8:30am-3:30pm. Admission is 500 THB. Wat Pho is located on 2 Sanamchai Road, Grand Palace Subdistrict, +66 2 662 3553, watpho.com. Opening daily from 8am–6:30pm. Admission is 100 THB. Wat Arun is across the river at 158 Wang Doem Road, +66 2 891 218. Open daily from 8am–5:30pm. Admission is 50 THB.\n\nNote: Be sure to wear clothes that cover your legs and shoulders; it’s considered disrespectful to wear revealing clothes. If you don’t, you can rent pants or shirts at the palace. At Wat Pho, they give them out for free.\n\nCruise the river\n\nTake a tour of the Chao Phraya river, a relaxing and beautiful experience that shouldn’t be skipped. Don’t take an overpriced tour, though. You can ride the water taxi up and down the river for around 20 baht (less than $1 USD). Start at the central pier, go to the end, and come back. Presto! Instant tour! (The difference with the official tourist boat, which makes less stops, is that they have someone that gives brief descriptions about important sites as you go.)\n\nTour the temples\n\nBangkok has a lot of beautiful temples. Hire a tuk-tuk driver to take you around for the day to see the temples. Just make sure he doesn’t take you shopping along the way — drivers get kickbacks if they bring customers into certain shops. They can be annoying about this but stay firm! This is often the cheapest and most efficient way to see the temples throughout Bangkok. My favorite temples are:\n\nWat Saket – The Golden Mount has an enormous, 100m-high, 500m wide chedi (mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics). This is one of my favorite temples in city because of its beautiful golden temple and wonderful views of the city from its top. 344 Chakkraphat Diphong Road, +66 2 478 6010, bangkokforvisitors.com/golden-mount.Open daily from 9am-5pm. Admission is 10 THB.\nWat Benchamabophit – This temple is pictured on the back of the 5-baht coin. The white marble used to contrast the building was imported directly from Italy, and t', 'uploads/1534978444405-bangkok4top.jpg', '2018-09-30'),
(4, 16, 'COSTA RICA 2018', 'COSTA RICA', 'Let’s go hiking,” I said one early morning at breakfast.\n\n“OK, we’ll go after lunch,” said Gloria and Lena. Gloria was a thirty-something olive skinned Spanish woman and her friend Lena, a short Latino with jet black hair from Chicago. Both were the only native Spanish speakers on the tour and helped me greatly improve my Spanish.\n\n“Gracias,” I replied.\n\nWe were in Arenal, a small town up in central Costa Rica famed for its active volcano of the same name, caving, lake, hot springs and gigantic waterfall. It was a stop on everyone’s itinerary. During the day, smoke rose from the volcano as lava oozed out of it casting a dusty appearance to the mountain. At night, flashes of red let you know lava is oozing down its side.\n\nIt was our second day there and I wanted to hike some of the (safe) trails around the mountain and catch the sunset over the lake.\n\nWe told the cab driver we’d be back at the park entrance at six and started off on our adventure to watch the sunset over the lake. We headed into the jungle, which often quickly thinned out to rocky trails spreading out like spider veins from the side of the mountains. These were remnants of eruptions long past. Dead earth that was slowly coming back to life. We wandered off the train and down these gravel paths, finding where they led. This was an adventure. I felt like Indiana Jones. I jumped over rocks and climbed boulders, getting Gloria and Lena to take photos of me. I followed unknown local animals around.\n\nReturning to the official trail, we walked towards the lake. On the way, we consulted the vague trail map our hotel had given us.', 'uploads/1534978567510-costa_rica.jpg', '2018-09-30'),
(5, 16, 'Taiwan GetAway', 'Taipei', 'I’m scared of heights. It’s not so much being high up that scares me, it’s more the fear of falling. Hike with me up a mountain and watch me stay far away from any edge. I once went hiking with a girlfriend and made her get away from the edge because it freaked me out too much. She laughed at me but I was visibly scared. Driving along winding mountain roads also freaks me out. I can’t sit on the road side of the car. Most of the time I will just close my eyes and try not to freak out! I only got over my fear of roller coasters a few years go. Any sign of turbulence in an airplane and my white knuckles grab the seat. Essentially, I don’t like being high up.\n\nSo it was with a little fear and trepidation that I went to go visit the tallest building in the world, Taipei 101.\n\nRising up from downtown, Taipei 101 is a sight to behold. I visited the building on my very last day living in Taiwan, and it was majestic. I’ve always seen the building as I moved through the city and I’ve been near it as there are a number of clubs in the surrounding district, but I’d never actually gone to see inside it or even seen it in daylight.\n\nBut there it was rising up from the city in a wave of green. It’s like a rocket ship.\n\nTaipei 101 is the most impressive modern structure I’ve ever seen. It rises up and towers over the surrounding area. 101 is a beautiful building built like a bamboo reed. Construction began in 1997 and was completed in 2004. It’s the tallest building in the world (well, it was until the one in Dubai was built and now an even taller structure is going to beat that) and, well, I can’t say this enough, quite impressive. It’s a very high-end building, and its offices and apartments are for those with money. There’s also the Taipei 101 mall, where you’ll find stores like Dolce and Gabana, Prada, Armani, Gucci, and many high-end restaurants. On my last night, I did eat at the sushi restaurant here, and though it cost me a fortune, it was the best meal I had in Taiwan.\n\nVisitors can head up to the 88th–91st floors and take a look outside at the surrounding city and mountains. Being the sadist I am, I bought my ticket, waited in line, and headed up the elevator. The elevator ride is actually really fun. There’s a screen that shows how fast you’re moving and where you are in the building. It takes about 30 seconds to go from bottom to top. I even felt my ears pop a little because you are going so high up! I mean that is insane!\n\nGetting up to the 89th floor, I got to see Taipei and the surrounding area in all its glory. It took me about 10 minutes before I even got up to the glass, but when I did, I saw how beautiful Taipei is from above. The city sort of reminded me of the game Sim City. All of the buildings, apartments, and industrial zones are laid out so perfectly that they almost seem artificial from above.\n\n\n\nAfter walking around and learning about the history of the area, I headed up to the 91st floor, where you can actually go outside. There are huge bars making sure people don’t fall or jump off, and the wind actually creates a loud pitch when it moves through the bars. The view isn’t that great because the iron bars sort of block your view, but you can get a good view of the tower that makes 101 the tallest building in the world. It also took me about 10 minutes to get to the edge and after a photo, I crawled right back to the center.\n\nWhat I really liked seeing was the building’s earthquake dampener. Down on the 88th floor, this big metal ball in the middle of the building is designed to help absorb any sway from powerful winds or earthquakes. Leading up to the ball is this very cool floor that is touch sensitive. When you walk over it, clouds disappear to show Taipei. I managed to get an OK video, but the tour groups that kept walking by me always got in my shot. Check it out:\n\n(It took me awhile but eventually, I made my way towards the window for the view. Yes, my fear is so irrational that I will am scared to go to the ', 'uploads/1534978651237-taipei101_004.jpg', '2018-09-30'),
(6, 16, 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'For years, I put off going to Japan because I was afraid of how expensive it would be. The rumors I’d heard about the country’s high prices made me hesitant to go. I’ve always loved Japanese culture, and I knew any visit would involve gorging on sushi and ramen, visits to lots of temples, and heavy train travel through the countryside. And the thought of how much that would cost always made me think, “I’ll wait until I have more money.”\n\nWhen I finally visited in 2011, I was shocked to discover that, while it isn’t cheap, Japan isn’t the prohibitively expensive country people may think it is. In fact, I actually found Japan to be very affordable and on par with (and sometimes cheaper than) countries in Western Europe. In subsequent visits, I’ve learned to further master the country and turn high-cost Japan into an affordable place to visit.\n\nHere’s how much things typically cost in Japan and how you can cut down your expenses to visit Japan on a budget and save lots of money!\n\nNote: 110 JPY = $1 USD\n\nSaving on Transportation in Japan\n\n\nTrains\nThe bullet train, while awesome, comfortable, and fast, is not cheap. Individual tickets can cost hundreds of dollars. Yet I think train travel is the best way to see the country, so in order to reduce your train costs, get a Japan Rail (JR) pass. The pass is indispensable for travel in Japan.\n\nThese passes cost 28,300 JPY for 7 days, 45,100 JPY for 14 days, and 57,700 JPY for 21 days. All pass times are for consecutive travel. Even if you just get the seven-day pass, it’s the same price as a round-trip train ticket from Osaka to Tokyo (14,250 JPY each way!). Moreover, these JR trains also serve local city areas and so can be used intra-city. I used my pass to get around Kyoto and Tokyo instead of buying metro tickets. So even if you aren’t going to do much travel around Japan, buying a pass is better than buying individual tickets. While the high price of the pass can cause sticker shock, the alternative is even worse.\n\nThough the pass can be up to 20% cheaper to buy online before you arrive, you can now purchase a Japan Rail Pass in Japan. Passes are available in the following country locations: Sapporo, Sendai, Niigata, Tokyo, Shinjuku, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Takamatsu, Hakata, New Chitose Airport, Narita Airport, Haneda Airport, and Kansai Airport.\n\nMetro\nMost of the city metro tickets cost 100–200 JPY for a single journey. (The price varies by distance and may often be higher.) Fares were usually around 220 JPY to travel across Tokyo but less for shorter distances. In most major cities, you can buy a day pass, which gives you unlimited travel for 24 hours for around 800 JPY.\n\nBuses\nBuses are a less expensive alternative to the bullet train system in Japan, but they take more time. For example, the two-hour bullet train ride from Tokyo to Osaka becomes a ten-hour bus ride. The price for that seat is 4,500 JPY, but at some point, you need to think about how much your time is worth. For me, saving some 10,000 JPY was not worth the extra seven hours of travel, since I had such limited time during my visit. If I’d had more time, I’d have simply taken the bus. There are also bus passes available that offer unlimited travel and begin at 10,000 JPY for three non-consecutive days of travel.\n\nFlights\nFlying has become better option these days. There are many budget carriers now serving Japan, and a flight search on sites like Momondo or Skyscanner will reveal them. In general, their prices are on par with bullet train tickets. ANA also offers a special last-minute $100 fares via a hidden page on their website. It’s only available to foreigners and can sometimes be cheaper than the flights you find on Skyscanner, especially for longer routes around the country.\n\nSaving on Food in Japan\n\nSurprisingly, I found food to be inexpensive in Japan. True, I have a sushi addiction that dramitcally increased the cost of my trip but, overall, I found that I was spending far less on food than I', 'uploads/1534978725543-SAM_0432.JPG', '2018-09-30'),
